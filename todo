- use faster data structure for player pieces
- cannot castle out of check
- create more comprehensive performance tests involving the AI, the number of iterations per unit time perhaps?
- use 4 64-bit numbers to represent each bit of the piece representation (i.e. 1st 64-bit number would represent the team, the rest of the numbers would be bit masked and shifted to represent the piece type in integer (switch case))
